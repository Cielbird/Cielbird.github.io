This is a video game that I developed in a team of 6 for a game jam in 2021. 
It was developed for the GMTK game jam, with the theme *"Joined Together"*.
It was ranked \#179 overall out of 5.6k submissions, landing it in the top 
3% of games submitted.

It is developed in Unity 3D using C#. It was developed in 48 hours, and all 
additional assets are our own.

Polished and well designed, it is a physics based platformer where the user 
gravitates towards orbs of light to pass each level.
